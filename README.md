## Technologies

- Through React, I've developed a user-friendly interface for the client. 
- WebSocket is utilized to receive real-time prices and news from the server.
- Deployed on [smartwiki.site](https://portalfinancechart.site)


## Description

The client has access to data on over 7,000 stocks from the American stock exchange.
They can buy and sell stocks at market prices using virtual money, allowing them to learn how to invest correctly for free.
The project provides historical reports to help the client keep track of their finances.
They can personalize their profile by adding favorite stocks to their watchlist.
